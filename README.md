Database Integrity Verification

Below is a simplified design and code setup for such a system. This example will include Python scripts for the uAgents, JSON configuration files, and a basic example of how DeltaV could be integrated.

agents/verification_agent.py
This script defines a uAgent that performs database integrity checks.

agents/reporting_agent.py
This script defines a uAgent that handles the reporting of issues.

database/db_interface.py
This script provides an interface to interact with the database.

main.py
This script is the entry point of the application.

Configuration Files
config/config.json
Configuration file for the verification agent.

config/delta_v_config.json
Configuration file for DeltaV integration (example structure).

Requirements File
requirements.txt
Dependencies needed for the project.

How to Run
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Main Script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will start both the reporting agent (Flask server) and the verification agent.

This example provides a foundational structure for a database integrity verification system using Fetch.ai, uAgents, and DeltaV.
